The breadSlice-bake Oath

I am but a slice in the loaf of developers.
I bake code with patience, sometimes burnt, sometimes golden.
I season it with curiosity, sugar it with humor,
and if it crumbles, I’ll knead it again.

May my repos be humble,
my commits honest,
my bugs educational,
and my projects always sprinkled with a little extra weirdness.

Signed,
breadSlice-bake

“Forever baking, forever baked.”
